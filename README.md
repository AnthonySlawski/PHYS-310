# PHYS-310
## Machine Learning for Physics and Astronomy Data Analysis 

This repository is dedicated to a collection of machine learning tasks and methodologies I learnt from my course PHYS310, covering both fundamental concepts and advanced techniques. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in machine learning. Below is an outline of the key areas covered:

## Classification Tasks
- **Decision Trees:** Investigate the application of decision trees in classification assignments, a foundational method in machine learning that models decisions and their possible consequences.
- **K-Nearest-Neighbours (KNN):** Classify instances based on the closest training examples in the feature space.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Effectively perform classification by finding the optimal separating hyperplane.
- **Logistic Regression:** A fundamental statistical model used for binary classification tasks.
## Regression Tasks
- **Linear Models:** Predicting a quantitative response.
- **Regularization:** Using techniques like Lasso and Ridge regression to prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization.
- **Gradient Descent:** Crucial for learning the parameters of various models.
## Evaluation and Optimization of ML Models
- **Cross Validation:** Assessing the predictive performance of your models and ensuring they generalize well to unseen data.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Optimizing the hyperparameters of your machine learning models to improve performance.
- **Feature Engineering:** Understanding the importance of feature selection and transformation in developing robust models.
## Ensemble Methods
- **Random Forests:** An ensemble learning method for classification and regression that improves predictive accuracy.
- **Boosting Methods:** Combine multiple weak learners to form a strong learner, enhancing model predictions.
## Dimensionality Reduction
- **Clustering:** Grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset.
## Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- **Activation Functions:** Crucial for introducing non-linearity into the model.
- **Training and Backpropagation:** Fundamentals of training neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm for adjusting the weights.
- **Convolutional Nets:** Especially powerful in processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images. **Checking out the famous MNIST dataset!**

This repository aims to provide an overview and practical examples of each of these areas, with a broad spectrum of machine learning tasks and techniques.
